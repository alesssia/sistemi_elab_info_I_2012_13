# Sistemi di elaborazione dell'Informazione I

This repository contains the material for the course *Sistemi di elaborazione dell'Informazione I* which was hold at Inter- faculty School of Strategic Studies, University of Turin, a.y. 2012/2013.
This website was rebuilt on March 2023 using the original material (the original website went offline when Alessia Visconti left the Department of Computer Science, University of Torino).

The website, which is derived from the [Carpentries workshop template](https://github.com/carpentries/workshop-template), Copyright Â© [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/), lives under the `gh-pages` branch.

The original Carpentries workshop template was modified in order to *a)* exclude files/pieces of code not required for this simpler website, *b)* adapt license and code of conduct, and *c)* modify style.
